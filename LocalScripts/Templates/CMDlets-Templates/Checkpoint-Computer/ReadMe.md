# NOTES

        1. CMDlet does not work in 7.X.X.
        
        2. A (Win7) File backup creates a restore point in tandeum so you may see,

         WARNING: A new system restore point cannot be created because one has already been created within the past 1440
        minutes. The frequency of restore point creation can be changed by creating the DWORD valuel
        'SystemRestorePointCreationFrequency' under the registry key 'HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows
        NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore'. The value of this registry key indicates the necessary time interval (in minutes)
        between two restore point creation. The default value is 1440 minutes (24 hours).

        - This cmdlet uses the CreateRestorePoint method of the SystemRestore class with a
        BEGIN_SYSTEM_CHANGE event. - Beginning in Windows 8, `Checkpoint-Computer` cannot create more
        than one system restore point each day. If you try to create a new restore point before the
        24-hour period has elapsed, Windows PowerShell generates the following error:

# Examples       

    ----------- Example 1: Create a system restore point -----------

    Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Install MyApp"

    This command creates a system restore point called Install MyApp. It uses the default
    APPLICATION_INSTALL restore point type.
    --- Example 2: Create a system MODIFY_SETTINGS restore point ---

    Checkpoint-Computer -Description "ChangeNetSettings" -RestorePointType MODIFY_SETTINGS

    This command creates a MODIFY_SETTINGS system restore point called "ChangeNetSettings".
