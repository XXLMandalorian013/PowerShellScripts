# WinGet Installers (64 Bit)

## Disclamer:

Most of these packages already exsisted and all credit goes to those who created and currently manage them. I just played with the peramiters to work for my needs. Some packages require a PC restart for them to show up, those are noted in the MD and the script.

## NOTES:

All installs are silent if ran via some form of PS Remoting. When ran locally they are unattended installs.

--Scope: Script with the "--Scope Machine" will install Machine wide, scripts with "--Scope User" or miss the "--Scope" perimeter are only installed on the profile running the WinGet CMD. Some installs are machine wide though ""--Scope Machine"" was not used, it will be noted in the script and .md of the installer.
